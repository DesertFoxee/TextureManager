## Title : Texture manager 

## Introduction :

This is a management support class, making it easier and more effective to textures.

##### Advantages:

- Manage by name (string)

- Simple creation manipulation

- Collision support (normal , cricle , pixel perfect)

PS: These are just my subjective opinions in the process of capturing and handling events with SFML
